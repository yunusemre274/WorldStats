Design a futuristic, high-contrast, fully interactive web UI for a data-driven world statistics platform.

🎨 GENERAL THEME

Build the entire interface in a dark futuristic cyber-theme, using:

Deep Black background (#000000)

Neon Purple (#9d4edd) accents

Electric Pink (#ff1b6b) highlights

Strong glowing borders, gradients, animated neon edges

Smooth micro-interactions and hover animations

Soft blur glassmorphism panels

Dynamic sliding / scrolling neon typography

🗺️ LANDING PAGE (Main Screen)

When the website loads, display a full-screen interactive world map (like amCharts / Leaflet / D3 style).

Requirements:

Map is centered with glowing borders

Countries glow neon purple on hover

Selected country pulses neon pink

A floating label appears on hover showing the country's name

Clicking a country opens the “Statistics Panel”

Also include in the background:

Slow-moving neon particles

Horizontal neon light streaks

Animated cyber grid pattern with slight transparency

Add a large header text:
“WORLD DATA MATRIX”, animated with:

letter-spacing animation

neon glow

sliding reveal

📊 STATISTICS PANEL UI (Opens After Country Selection)

Create a right-side expandable panel with glassmorphism style:

Background: transparent black + blur

Neon purple border glow

Smooth slide-in animation

Organize the statistics into categories with collapsible sections:

▶ 1. Demographics

Average IQ score

Male–Female ratio

Child population percentage

Literacy rate

Addiction rates (smoking, alcohol, substances)

Population charts (Pie, Line, Bar)

Charts should use neon purple & neon pink glow themes.

▶ 2. Military Data

Global military strength ranking

Active personnel count

Military budget (optional)

Pie chart: categories of military assets

Animated number counters

▶ 3. Crime Statistics

Overall crime index

PieChart showing crime categories

▶ 4. Economic & Political Indicators

GDP per capita

Government type

EU/NATO membership badges

Passport ranking indicator

Neon badge icons with glow

🧭 TOP NAVIGATION BAR

Create a minimal futuristic top bar with:

Left: Logo “DATA-ORB” with neon morphing animation

Center: Sliding/scrolling neon purple text (cyber-ticker moving left to right)

Right: Settings button (gear icon, neon pink glow)

Hover effects:

Scale + glow bloom

🔘 INTERACTIVE BUTTONS

Buttons must be highly animated:

Neon purple to neon pink gradient

Glow pulse

Soft hover expansion

Ripple wave on click

🌀 ADDITIONAL UI ELEMENTS

Neon-outlined cards for each stat category

Animated progress bars in neon colors

Gradient glowing separators

Futuristic icons (thin, line-based, neon-outlined)
